# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, models were create and then evaluated with the help of the libraries imbalanced-learn as well as scikit-learn to organize models and analyze with the help of resampling method. We oversampled and undersampled data with SMOTE and ClusterCentroids alogrithms. BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were also used to compare the modules that decreased bias.
